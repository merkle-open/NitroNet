## Configuration

### Requirements regarding the file structure of your frontend application
If you are building your frontend with [Nitro](https://github.com/namics/generator-nitro/), you already have a valid file structure and there is nothing to consider.

If you build your handlebars frontend yourself or with another generator, there are the following things you have to consider:

#### You want to use Nitro helpers
If you want to use the Nitro handlebars helpers (mainly regarding the `{{component [...]}}` helper), your frontend has to meet the following requirements:
- Every component must have its own file.
- The component name has to be identical to the file name of the respective component. And every component must have a unique name!
	- Example: The file for a teaser component has to be named `teaser.[file extension]`
- The base component has to be in a folder with the same name.
	- Example: The `teaser` component has to be in `[components folder]/teaser/teaser.[file extension]`
- The variations respectively skins of your base component have to be in the same folder as the base  component. You can distinguish your variations with a `-` following the name of the variation. [Read more about skins here (keyword: template)](https://github.com/namics/generator-nitro/blob/master/generators/app/templates/project/docs/nitro.md#render-patterns)
	- Example: the `teaser-blue` variation has to be in `[components folder]/teaser/teaser-blue.[file extension]`
	- Example: the `teaser-red` variation has to be in `[components folder]/teaser/teaser-red.[file extension]`

The file paths of your components have to be registered in the **componentPaths** node of the configuration. [Read more down below](#change-the-frontend-file-paths).

#### You won't be using the Nitro helpers
If your are not using the `{{component [...]}}` helper from Nitro, your frontend has to meet the following requirements:
- Every partial must have its own file.
- The partial name has to be identical to the file name of the respective partial. And every partial must have a unique name!
	- Example: The file for a teaser partial has to be named `teaser.[file extension]`

The file paths of your partials have to be registered in the **partialPaths** node of the configuration. [Read more down below](#change-the-frontend-file-paths).

### Change the location of your frontend application
The location of your frontend application can be configured very flexibly.

As default it is set to be located at the root folder of your web application. If you like to change it, you can add an AppSetting with the Key-Value *NitroNet.BasePath* in your *Web.config*:

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="NitroNet.BasePath" value="[path of your choice]" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

But keep in mind that the *NitroNet.BasePath* has to be relative to the root directory. Absolute paths are not working.

### Change the frontend file paths
In addition, you got a new `nitronet-config.json.example`-File in the root directory of the website project after installation of NitroNet for Sitecore. Rename it to `nitronet-config.json` to activate the config.

```json
{
  "viewPaths": [
    "frontend/views/"
  ],
  "partialPaths": [
    "frontend/views/_partials",
  ],
  "componentPaths": [
    "frontend/patterns/atoms",
    "frontend/patterns/molecules",
    "frontend/patterns/organisms",
  ],
  "extensions": [
    "hbs",
    "html"
  ],
    "filters": [
    ".*?\\/template\\/([\\w][^\\/]+)$",
    ".*?\\/spec\\/([\\w][^\\/]+)$"
 ]
}
```

Explanation to the individual settings/properties:
* **viewPaths**: The file path to your views, starting at your `NitroNet.BasePath`
* **partialPaths**: The file path to your partials, starting at your `NitroNet.BasePath`
* **componentPaths**: The file path to your components, starting at your `NitroNet.BasePath`
* **extensions**: The extensions of your handlebar files.
* **filters**: File paths which match with the `filters` regex are being ignored

### *Optional:* Add and register your own custom helpers
As mentioned before, NitroNet comes with support for the [Nitro](https://github.com/namics/generator-nitro/) custom handlebars helpers by default.

But you can add your own helpers as well. You can achieve this by doing the following steps (the instructions are shown using the Unity IoC framework):

1.) Create your own helpers by implementing the `NitroNet.ViewEngine.ViewEngines.HandlebarsNet.IHandlebarsNetHelperHandler`. See the classes in `NitroNet.ViewEngine.TemplateHandler.HandlebarsNet` for reference.

2.) Create your own implementation of the `NitroNet.ViewEngine.ViewEngines.HandlebarsNet.IHandlebarsNetHelperHandlerFactory`. You can take the `NitroNet.ViewEngine.TemplateHandler.HandlebarsNet.HandlebarsNetHelperHandlerFactory` as a basis for your code.

```csharp
public class YourOwnHelperHandlerFactory : IHandlebarsNetHelperHandlerFactory
{
    public List<KeyValuePair<string, HandlebarsHelper>> Create(){
      var helpers = new List<KeyValuePair<string, HandlebarsHelper>>();

      // add your helpers here

      return helpers;
    }

    public List<KeyValuePair<string, HandlebarsBlockHelper>> CreateForBlocks(){
      var helpers = new List<KeyValuePair<string, HandlebarsBlockHelper>>();

      // add your block-helpers here

      return blockHelpers;
        }
    }
```

3.) Register your implementation of `IHandlebarsNetHelperHandlerFactory` to your IoC container. The following example is for Unity and is added to the `RegisterTypes()` method in the `UnityConfig` class:

```csharp
container.RegisterType<IHandlebarsNetHelperHandlerFactory, YourOwnHelperHandlerFactory>(new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());
```

after the following line:

```csharp
new DefaultUnityModule(basePath).Configure(container);
```
