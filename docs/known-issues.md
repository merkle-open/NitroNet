## Limitations
Unfortunately not all handlerbars features are supported in NitroNet. This is due to the underlying handlebars parser [Veil](https://github.com/csainty/Veil/tree/master/src/Veil.Handlebars) we are using.

To have an overview of what works and what not you can consult the [documentation of Veil.Handlebars](https://github.com/csainty/Veil/tree/master/src/Veil.Handlebars).

### General features

#### Partials with passed context
It is currently not possible (because of the underlying Veil) to have partials with a passed context:
```
{{> myPartial myOtherContext }}
```

But for this case there is a workaround. You can change the context with the `{{#with}}` like this:
```
{{#with myOtherContext}}
    {{> myPartial}}
{{/with}}
```

#### Master pages
With our modified version of the handlebars parser *Veil* it is not possible to use the master page feature. This is because we made some major changes to the class *VeilEngine* and thus we are not passing the *VeilContext* here.

A possible way to mitigate the absence of master templates is to extract all the common parts into partials or components (see the [samples](samples.md)).

## Currently not implemented

### Nitro features

#### Flexible attributes on component helper
You will find the Nitro documentation for the flexible attribute [here](https://github.com/merkle-open/generator-nitro/blob/master/packages/generator-nitro/generators/app/templates/project/docs/nitro.md#render-patterns).

```
{{pattern 'example' modifier='blue'}}
```

In the current version NitroNet does not support this feature. You need to pass another data variation:
```
{{pattern 'example' data='example-blue'}}
```

#### Render patterns with children
You will find the Nitro documentation for patterns with children [here](https://github.com/merkle-open/generator-nitro/blob/master/generators/app/templates/project/docs/nitro.md#render-patterns-with-children).

```
{{#pattern 'box'}}
    {{pattern 'example'}}
{{/pattern}}
```

In the current version NitroNet does not support this feature. Please use the placeholder feature for this use case.

#### Translation handlebars helper
Nitro ships with a Handlebars helper called `t`. This is not supported in NitroNet as there is no need for such a helper in ASP.NET. You can just use a string expressions in its place and fill the according model property dynamically with data from any source.
