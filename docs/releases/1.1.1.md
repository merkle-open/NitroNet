### New Features / Enhancements
- Greatly improved documentation:
	- Updated, corrected and extended
	- Improved structure
	- Better syntax highligthing of code examples
- Partials are now working with the familiar syntax from handlebars: `{{> myPartial }}`
- Prereleases are now supported by the build routine and delivered via nuget.org if necessary
- The custom handlebars helper `{{pattern [...]}}` of *Nitro* is now supported. It works the same way as `{{component [...]}}`
- NitroNet configuration:
	- It is now possible to configure which file extensions *NitroNet* should respect
	- It is now possible to set filter regex' to exclude specific file paths from *NitroNet*
	- An example config is now delivered by the NuGet package
- NitroNet now has the ability to read multi line handlebars helpers
- Exception handling has been improved:
	- An Exception is thrown if the view name is not unique. Generally it is recommended to use full file paths
	- An Exception is thrown if there is more than one pattern/component with the same name

### Fixed Issues
- NitroNet invoked multiple controllers in plain MVC applications. This has been fixed.
- A specific path is now only watched by one file watcher (`NitroNet.ViewEngine.IO.FileSystem`)
- More robust resolving of the *DefaultTemplate* (`NitroNet.ViewEngine.DefaultComponentRepository`)
- `NitroNet.UnityModules` and `NitroNet.CastleWindsorModules` now reference the correct `NitroNet.Core` dependency
- There are no longer exceptions thrown when frontend files are changed and *NitroNet* is running

### Removed Features / Breaking Changes
- NitroNet configuration:
	- The file was renamed from `config.json` to `nitronet-config.json`
	- The initial example config has to be renamed from `nitronet-config.json.example` to `nitronet-config.json` to make *NitroNet* work
- AsyncLocal has been removed. It was legacy code from the previous project and is no longer needed.

### Update/Installation Instructions

#### Configuration upgrade
Do a backup of your current `config.json` before updating NitroNet to this version. After updating you must have a `nitronet-config.json` instead of the `config.json`. Please make sure to move your settings from the `config.json` to the `nitronet-config.json` and that all config nodes are present in the config (*viewpaths*, *partialPaths*, *componentPaths*, *extensions* and *filters*). If nodes are missing there will be an exception.
