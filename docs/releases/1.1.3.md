### Fixed Issues
- A *NullReferenceException* was frequently thrown when developing locally. This was due to the `_fileInfoCache` in `NitroNet.ViewEngine/IO/FileSystem.cs` being reset before the new fileInfo was read from disk (which could take 2-3 minutes in large projects) - PR [25](https://github.com/namics/NitroNet/pull/25), thanks [Mark Lowe](https://github.com/lowedown) for this contribution.
